        <h1 id="h1">Naya Raipur</h1>
        officially known as Atal Nagar-Nava Raipur,[1] is a planned city and fully Greenfield city in Indian
        state of Chhattisgarh. It is planned to replace Raipur as the capital city of Chhattisgarh.[2][3] The Government
        of Chhattisgarh, the state's administrative body is situated here. The city is located between National Highway
        53 and National Highway 30, about 17 km south-east of the capital city Raipur. Swami Vivekananda Airport
        separates Raipur and Nava Raipur. Naya Raipur has land pool of 17000 hectares in which it covers an area of
        about 8000 hectares that includes 41 villages out of which 27 villages form the core of Naya Raipur

        About half of the total acquired land is being used for public facilities; 23% of the land would be reserved for
        government and educational institutions; and 30% of the land will be used for residential and economical
        purposes. The city is envisaged to accommodate about 560,000 people by phase III, i.e., within 2031 as per the
        Master Development Plan prepared by Naya Raipur Development Authority now Nava Raipur Atal Nagar Development
        Authority. Provisions have been made for its expansion and to upgrade infrastructure in the future.

    <br>
    <p>Planning
        A comprehensive exercise was undertaken to find a perfect location for the city. An imaginary circle of 50 km
        radius was drawn around Raipur and this massive area was divided into four quadrants.

        Each quadrant was analysed in context of regional development, existing development, climatic factors, flora and
        fauna, water resources, transport network etc. and the efforts yielded the present site southeast of Raipur at
        about 15 km distance, close to Mana Airport. The site selection methodology and site profile are detailed.[4]

    <p>Nava Raipur Development Authority
        After the formation of the new state of Chhattisgarh in November 2000, the state government decided to create a
        well planned new city for Raipur. Hence a special area has been notified under section 64 of Nagar Tatha
        Gramnivesh Adhiniyam 1973.

        The authority thus formed is the Capital Area Development Authority (CADA) which is now called the Atal Nagar
        Vikas Pradhikaran (NRDA). NRDA is the nodal agency undertaking comprehensive development of this 'greenfield'
        city.

        Chief executive officers are appointed by government and other officers and staff working under NRDA
        organisation.[5] Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer P. Joy Oommen is the chairman of the NRDA, while
        Amit Kataria is its chief executive.</p>

    <p>Vision for development
        Naya Raipur would be a ‘green city’ in every sense of the term. Large areas would be brought under tree
        plantation, arrangements would be made for water conservation and waste water recycling, and non-conventional
        energy resources would be used to the maximum.[7]
        It would reflect the rich heritage and culture of Chhattisgarh and India in its urban design and architecture.
        Special efforts would be taken to make it a people friendly and visitor friendly city.[8]
        The city's design would a promote sense of security and comfort among its citizens, especially women, children
        and the physically challenged.</p>
